C Programming Summary

What is a macro in C, and how is it defined?
A macro in C is a preprocessor directive used to define constants or code snippets that are substituted before compilation. It is defined using #define.
Example:
#define PI 3.14
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

What is the difference between macros and functions?
Macros:
- Preprocessed before compilation.
- No type checking.
- Faster, no function call overhead.
- Harder to debug.
Functions:
- Compiled normally with type checking.
- Easier to debug.
- Can be inlined but usually have overhead.

What do #ifdef, #ifndef, and #endif do?
These are conditional compilation directives.
- #ifdef MACRO: Checks if MACRO is defined.
- #ifndef MACRO: Checks if MACRO is not defined.
- #endif: Ends the conditional block.

What does malloc() do, and what type does it return?
malloc() allocates memory at runtime and returns a void pointer (void*) to the allocated space.

What is the difference between malloc, calloc, and realloc?
- malloc: Allocates memory but does not initialize it.
- calloc: Allocates and initializes memory to zero.
- realloc: Resizes previously allocated memory.

Why must we always call free() after dynamic allocation?
To release memory back to the system and avoid memory leaks.

What is a header guard, and what problem does it solve?
A header guard prevents a header file from being included multiple times, avoiding redefinition errors.

What is the typical format of a header guard?
#ifndef HEADER_NAME_H
#define HEADER_NAME_H
// code
#endif

How does the preprocessor handle nested includes?
The preprocessor expands all includes. Header guards prevent the same file from being processed more than once, even if nested.
